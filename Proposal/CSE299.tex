\section{Introduction}
The proposed application will be selling products such as desktops, laptops, computer accessories, SSDs, and other related technology gadgets. Since, e-commerce is getting much popular as a new media to expand and reach more customers, businesses are very eager to use such technology. \par
The objective of this project is to develop a web site where products can be viewed and users can buy items online using their PC or smartphone. \par
This is a virtual store where customers can browse the catalog and add products they want to buy to their cart. Later they can checkout the items from their cart and choose to pay online or Payment on Delivery.

\section{Description}
The general objective of the project is to design and develop an online shopping experience. The system should have the following features: \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item A catalog of products with multiple categories.
    \item User based cart management.
    \item Online Payment or Payment on Delivery option.
    \item Delivery Management System.
    \item Inventory Management System.
    \item Accounting Management System.
\end{itemize}
There will be three types of user: \par
\begin{itemize}
    \item Admin
    \item Employee
    \item Customer
\end{itemize}

\section{Features}
\subsection{Catalog of Products}
Like shelves on a physical store, our online store will have products which will be divided into different categories, the categories will be dynamic, so employees can add new categories without accessing the code.

\subsection{User Cart}
Every time an user adds a product to their cart, it'll stay there till the user checks it out or removes it.

\subsection{Online Payment}
There will be an online payment gateway for the users to pay using their card or digital wallet, there will be a payment on delivery option as well.

\subsection{Delivery}
Users will be able to track their orders and see status of the delivery.

\subsection{Inventory}
The system will automatically keep track of product availability depending on the data provided by an employee.

\subsection{Accounting}
The system will keep track of all the transactions of the system; such as purchases, invoices, payments etc.

\section{Technology}
We decided to use Django with REST API as our backend and React for our Frontend.

\subsection{Frontend}
Since our site needs to be attractive and smooth, we planned to use React.JS, a javascript web framework, developed by Facebook. This will give us plenty of wiggle room on how much customization we can make to the system. The Frontend will generally deal with data viewing, beautification of site, and send data back and from to the API.

\subsection{Backend}
We are using Django, a python web framework as our backend system and PostgreSQL as our Relational Database System. Django gives us a lot of room to add functionality to our system. We will be building an API, using the Django REST framework, which will bridge the connection between backend and frontend. \par
Django will take care of authentication. We plan to use third part authentication API to make sure people can login with their Google/Facebook or other popular platform's account.

\subsubsection{Payment method}
We are planning to use SSLCommerz's Sandbox as our payment gateway.

\section{DevOps}
The code will be configured with CI and CD using GitHub Actions. It'll automatically create pull requests when some basic tests are passed by our code, and after we verify the pull requests to the main branch, the CD will automatically deploy it to our cloud provider. \par
We will be using GCP/AWS/Azure as our Cloud provider. We will use their Kubernetes solutions to automatically orchestrate our dockerized application, so it runs and scales automatically on the fly.

\section{Monetization}
If the system is developed for one specific e-commerce company, then it'd be used a tool. Since, an e-commerce company will be using this tool to sell better their product, the system will have a significant contribution to the revenue. \par
But if the system is developed as a platform where multiple e-commerce sites shares the same codebase, then this system itself can be a product and we can charge 5-7\% sales margin to small business, or create a monthly/yearly/perpetual licensing system, with addons like hosting, customization, etc.

\section{Social Impact}
During pandemics like the one we are currently experiencing right now (COVID-19), some retail business had to sustain loss due to not having safer ways to sell their product. Selling online was one of their key strategies to overcome the issue. In order to sell online they needed to develop e-commerce sites like the one we are developing. General purpose solutions like WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Shopify, etc has very little customizability and the stacks they were developed in are sometimes close-source, backdated, or maybe even limited because of technology. Our system would bring a change and make businesses run fully online and make shopping experience better for customers. \par

Our system is helping people stay safe during a pandemic by shopping online and it's helping businesses keep running. Our system has the ability to automatically scale, which eliminated system downtime. And due to integration of tools like Inventory, Accounts, Payment, most of the businesses' employees can work from home.
